yum-toc
=======

Have you ever done a "# rpm -qai" to see the summary line of the RPM packages installed on your system?  Have you ever longed to know just what each of those RPM packages in your repository is for?

Now you can run yum-toc(8) to get such a listing of every available RPM package in every YUM repository you are tracking.
